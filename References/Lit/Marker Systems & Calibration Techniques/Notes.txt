Figure 4: This figure provides a visual representation of the calibration process for multi-camera systems. It likely showcases the spatial arrangement of cameras, the markers used for calibration, and the resultant field of view after calibration. The figure might also include error metrics or heatmaps to indicate the accuracy and consistency of the calibration across different cameras. This visual representation emphasizes the importance of calibration in ensuring that pose estimation is consistent across all cameras in the system.

Figure 1: This figure displays the various fiducial markers used in the study, including ARTag, AprilTag, ArUco, and STag. Each marker might be shown with its unique pattern, highlighting the distinguishing features that aid in pose estimation. For instance, the STag marker's circular pattern in its center, which is crucial for refining the initial homography using elliptical fitting, would be prominently displayed. This figure serves as a visual guide to understanding the physical appearance and design intricacies of each marker type.
By closely examining these figures, one can gain a comprehensive understanding of the marker systems, their design, and the calibration techniques employed. The visual representations not only aid in grasping the theoretical aspects but also provide a practical perspective on how these systems are implemented and their real-world performance.
